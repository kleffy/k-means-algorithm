# K-Means Algorithm

There are 3 important steps in the K-Means Clustering algorithm.

1. Initialize centroids – This is done by selecting K points at random, which can be points from the dataset or random points.
2. Assign Clusters – Each point in the dataset is assigned a cluster by calculating its distance from the centroid and assigning it to the centroid with the shortest distance.
3. Recalculate the centroids – Update the centroid by calculating the centroid of each cluster we've created.
